				The bustling main street and busy bus stop outside couldn’t do much to stop my thoughts. I’m early unlike usual, I’m not ready unlike usual. Steam from my latte tantalising my senses, the burning warmth nestled in my fingers soothed the tension I faced about this meeting. Inside this cosy café the world became distant as I lost myself in the homeliness of the oak interior.<br />
				<br />
				A week of silence turned into a month, I think I had made a good decision. Maybe time could teach him. Maybe he’d finally pickup my hints. It was hard at the beginning, but it got easier. Then he began his odd antics again. I’d be baffled with his messages at times, how do I respond to these? I’d ask my girlfriends who called him a weirdo. Even my best man told me he was weird. It’s been two months since I talked to him, but it’s the first time he’s asked me to join him for a meal.  <br />
				<br />
				Oh how this friendship turned out, we’ve spoken about this few times. It’s a truly unexpected one beginning humbly when he sent a message to a classmate. My unexpected reply had boosted his confidence and then we simply kicked off to a unique friendship. I still laugh when I think about him calling me popular: he calls himself a wall flower when his social life is better than mine. Late nights spent working on assignments were also spent in his online company. Half my screen would have my essays being typed, the other half would have our messages on screen. <br />
				<br />
				Curiosity drove my end of the friendship. He was everything I hadn’t seen before. I’d never met a man with such little self-esteem. A man so broken and shattered as him. And yet, there was no man as genuine as him. He was the most responsible man I’ve ever come across in my life, he had a vision about what he wanted with his life; he wanted to be the son his family needed. I related to him as I faced my own trials. We became each other’s confidants and ill-experienced advisors. <br />
				<br />
				Our conversations would spiral about the quietness of the night, or the hues of the skies. The greens of the land and different seasons. Personal philosophies were so easy to talk about- but then again we never spoke as much in person. Our closeness was the magic of modern messaging, what millennial would have a heart-to-heart conversation in person, no one’s brave enough to do that nowadays. SNS served as our median, my veil to the world as I sipped a hot coco and smiled at his words.<br />
				<br />
				A breathy salutation with the waft of his cologne, I looked up to a familiar face in front of me. Dark eyes gleaming with masked joy, his expression humble as always. “Did you wait long?”. He asked, placing his coat on the chair. “What’s up with you? You’re never quiet” he chuckled hesitantly. <br />
				<br />
				“Your order’s on its way.” I spoke up to hear his blatant protest. <br />
				<br />
				“How could you? I asked you out for lunch today, it’s only right that I pay,” he kept his ground. Unbuttoning the top button to his office shirt, a teasing silver of that tattoo speaking his mind peeking through.<br />
				<br />
				“Don’t sweat it, I’ve got it covered.”<br />
				<br />
				“But still-” the sharp man was cut off with a server bringing his steak to the table. The man ogled at the pristine cut of meat cooked to perfection. “This is too much, share it with me.”<br />
				<br />
				Placing the empty cup of coffee on the table, I took in the sight before me. “Consider this a repayment for my birthday.” He ate his food deliciously, it was satisfying enough simply watching the scrawny man I met in university still eat the same way years on.<br />
				<br />
				“That was your birthday!” the outburst came from behind a napkin to his lips. “A birthday treat is the least I could have done. Plus that place was really good” he pointed with his knife while forking his salad. Skilled as always, even with that little butterfly necklace he bought as a gift.<br />
				<br />
				“You ordered too much food for yourself and forced yourself to finish everything before we headed out.” I chuckled at the memory. The beautiful day at the beach was cut short as strong winds whiplashed sand on bare calves like shards of glass. <br />
				<br />
				“Still good though. Plus, you were there, that made it better.” Plum lips curled into a smile as he spoke while slicing his steak. “You made it up for the meal then, you bought us all ice cream, remember? That gelato place was awesome, wanna head there afterwards? My treat.” Earning a shake of my head the inked man before me smiled that heart-breaking smile. “I missed this. Us talking. Conversation means a lot to me, you know that right?”<br />
				<br />
				It’s hurts so much, but I need to do this. “Solitude has its benefits too.”<br />
				<br />
				A beat of silence fell between us and the man became serious. “You’ve gotten so distant, stop hiding yourself and look me in the eye”. This needs to stop, Dave, please stop making things harder than they already are.<br />
				<br />
				“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”<br />
				<br />
				“Your mind is enthralling, you know that, right?” I don't think I'll completely get over you. <br />
				<br />
				“Jade-” It pained me to see his puzzled expression. You really don’t get it, do you?<br />
				<br />
				How do I tell you about this control you have over me, the control that shouldn’t be there. “I’m leaving.” I sighed, this is exasperating. “I’ve tried my hardest but I realise I value you before anything else. I’m not going to be here and hurt either of us anymore.<br />
				<br />
				“That’s a harsh joke, you’ve never hurt me.” He chuckled while forking his steak. Unfortunately, it’s not the same the other way around. “We’ve been friends for years now. Where are you going? I’ll grab you at the airport.”<br />
				<br />
				“Leave to fate if we cross paths again, Yongguk. I thought proper closure would be good.”<br />
				<br />
				Dark eyes pierced my soul, “I don’t know why you’re thinking all this. You have no idea how happy you make me.”<br />
				<br />
				And for once, I can’t relate to the man before me. I can’t do this anymore, “I love myself too much to let you win when you’ve never tried.”<br />
				<br />
				Frustration built up in the tanned man’s eyes. “What’s there to win?” he sighed.<br />
				<br />
				You deserve the best. You really do. “It’s so easy to love you, but you can’t win.”<br />
				<br />
				And that’s when it finally clicked for him. Finally, that beat of silence after a confession. “Jade-…”<br />
				<br />
				“It’s not your fault I fell, I’m just too stubborn to admit my defeat.” I offered with a pathetic smile. “It’s so easy to fall for a man with a mind like yours. Back then people had their eyes on you and your good looks.  Little did they know how amazing it is to be with you.” Fond memories of him nose deep in the reference section of the library came to mind as did the bitter whispers slipping in from afar. The glowing baritone animatedly discussing his findings on the effects of capitalism on economic divide drowned out my longing and those distant whispers. “You’ll go far with the right person beside you.”<br />
				<br />
				Finally, he knows. All good things must come to an end, the pregnant silence that didn’t break would hold on until fate called it off. This was the empty page to our story’s end. Placing a few bills on the table and took my leave. The bustling streets welcomed me in a warm embrace of clothed beings moving towards a place called home. My existence camouflaged in a concrete jungle, I caught a glimpse of him in the street looking around. Don’t find me Yongguk, you have no idea how free I feel. I won’t let a man who never wanted me have control over my heart and mind. <br />
				<br />
				Never. <br />
				<br />
				Where’s an end, there’s always a beginning.  <br />
				<br />
				Till fate leads our paths to cross again, this is goodbye. <br />
				<br />
